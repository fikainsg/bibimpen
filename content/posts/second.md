I had a wonderful time playing golf at Forest City Golf Resort in Johor last weekend. This resort has two amazing courses: the LGK Classic Course and the JN Legacy Course. Both courses are designed by renowned golf architects Jack Nicklaus and Liang Guo Kun, and offer stunning views of the natural landscape and the straits of Johor.

I played on the Classic Course, which features a three-dimensional garden landscape with rolling hills, lakes, streams and bunkers. The course is challenging but fair, with strategic holes that require accuracy and creativity. The greens are fast and smooth, and the fairways are well-maintained. I especially enjoyed the par-5 18th hole, which has a dramatic elevation change and a water hazard guarding the green.

The resort also has excellent facilities, such as a clubhouse, a pro shop, a driving range, a restaurant and a hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the service is top-notch. I highly recommend Forest City Golf Resort to anyone who loves golf and nature. It is truly a world-class destination for golfers of all levels.

Here are some pros and cons of Forest City Golf Resort:

Pros:
- Two beautiful courses with different styles and challenges
- Convenient location near Singapore
- Modern amenities and services
- Affordable rates compared to other golf resorts

Cons:
- The golf gear at the pro shop is pricey
- The mega-project's fate is unclear due to environmental concerns[^1^][3] [^2^][4]
- The resort can get crowded during peak seasons
